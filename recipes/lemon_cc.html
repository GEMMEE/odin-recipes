       <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How can you not smile sinking your teeth into one of these? The happiest cupcake in the world! 
        Today’s homemade lemon cupcakes are incredibly soft and bursting with lemon, just like my lemon cake. 
        Not too much lemon that you’ll squint your eyes and pucker up your lips, but just enough to give each
     bite a refreshing zest of citrus flavor.
    </p>  
    
    <p>To make lemon cupcakes it will take you roughly around 1 hour and 
        25 minutes, including a preparation time. For preparation you might
        need around 50 minutes and for cooking around 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For the lemon cupcakes, you'll need:
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups self-rising flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
        </ul>  
    </p>
    <p>And for the Lemon Cream Icing, you’ll need:
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chilled heavy cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>The steps needed are:
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each egg until incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.</li>
            <li>Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture, one third at a time, alternating with half the milk and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing them to finish cooling on a rack.</li>
            <li>To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream begins to thicken. Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to High, and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes. Spread on the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Bon Appetite! your lemon cupcake is now ready.</p>
